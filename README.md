### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup\
-   CSS custom properties\

While working on this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

-   Centering layouts using **Flexbox**\
-   Creating responsive card components\
-   Using CSS variables for cleaner styling\
-   Improving mobile-first structure

Here's a small snippet of code I'm proud of:

``` css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving:

-   Writing cleaner and more scalable CSS\
-   Accessibility and keyboard navigation\

-   Improving responsiveness across various device sizes

### Useful resources

    CSS and HTML references\

    Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) --
